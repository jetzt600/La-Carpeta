Hello, I joined Github last week, created and initiated my first two repositories. Now I want to add, commit and push revised files to those repositories. When I pushed the revised files, I received the following response: ----------------------------------------- $ git push fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream origin master ------------------------------------------ So I did, and received response: My Name@DESKTOP-32QET7M TINGS64 ~/Desktop (master) --- (I revised this line, with same type of characters) $ git push --set-upstream origin master fatal: unable to access 'https://gitbuh.com/AnneMarieHarm/deliverable_one.git/': Could not resolve host: gitbuh.com ------------------------------------ I wonder how it became 'gitbuh.com' (not 'github.com')? And why I can't seem to push revised files to my respositories? Any help anyone may be able to provide, would be appreciated. I've reviewed help files and references, and found this other user receiving some of the same responses (https://github.community/t5/How-to-use-Git-and-GitHub/Pushing-to-collaborator-s-private-repo-from-te...

Thank you!
